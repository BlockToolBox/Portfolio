# PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

Attempt this if you have completed the 3 tutorials below 

* https://github.com/BlockToolBox/TickerTape

* https://github.com/BlockToolBox/Web3-Chat

* https://github.com/BlockToolBox/ToolsToken

This time we raise the bar a bit for the beginners. We started with a few lines of basic HTML to get a ticker tape going via the Coingecko API. 

We then looked more on chain, with a chat messenger box that allows you chat across multiple EVMs. 

We setup a solidity smart contract for an ERC-20 token. 

Now, we look at:

- how to get useful information out of a token quickly
- managing split files across HTML, JS, CSS and Assets for a Favicon or any other purpose
- Integrating Coingecko API for some token information
- Integration Etherscan API for some token information
- Adding some calculations for a portfolio value based on the Token price x holdings
- Getting the Marketcap (Replace 100,000, which is the tools Total Supply, with the TS of the Token you are tracking)
- Adding additional information to this such as a Tiers system for amount of holdings.

You will need to get a free API KEY from Etherscan. 

The TOOLS token has been used as an example here. 

PS - The tiers are only examples, not the actual Tier system to be employed at BLOCKTOOLS DAO, please use only for representation purpose. 

Go ahead and try this with different tokens! (Modify the CG API endpoints accordingly)
